# Tenzies Game üé≤

**Tenzies** is a simple and interactive dice game built with React. The objective of the game is to roll dice untill all dice show the same value. You can freeze a die at its current value to keep it from rolling in subsequent attempts.

This project includes features like visual feedback for held dice (highlighted background), tracking the number of rolls, and a win condition that triggers confetti to celebrate your victory. After winning, the game allows players to adjust the number of dice for a more customized experience.

## Features üöÄ

- **Interactive Dice Roll:** Roll up to 10 dice with random values between 1 and 6.
- **Hold Mechanism:** Click on dice to freeze their values to change background color.
- **Tracking mechanism:** Tracks the number of rolls to achieve victory.
- **Adjustable Dice count:** After winning, you can adjust the number of dice.
- **Winning Condition:** The game detects when all dice are held and have the same value.
- **Confetti Celebration:** A fun animation is displayed when you win.
- **Responsive Design:** The app works seamlessly across different devices.
